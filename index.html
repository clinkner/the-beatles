                    <p><br/><br/>Ask any of my friends, I'm horrible at finding music. My genre of choice mimicks that of my 79 year old grandfather. "It's a safe bet," I always say, "who isn't going to like a classic Beatles song?" When it's my turn on the aux, I take a dive backwards into musics past. In secret, I think I don't like finding new music because I'm too emotionally invested in my classics. Listening to The Beatles on my drives into Northern Michigan To love new artists the same way would feel like treason, adultry, betrayal to the bands I've known and loved. Thus, using my language of love (front-end development and design) this website is my love song to The Beatles.</p>

                <h1>About</h1>

                <p>The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. With a line-up comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they are regarded as the most influential band of all time. </p> <!-- source from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles -->

            	<div class='hide'> <p> The Beatles were integral to the evolution of pop music into an art form and to the development of the counterculture of the 1960s.Their sound, rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways. They also pioneered recording techniques and explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As they continued to draw influences from a variety of cultural sources, their musical and lyrical sophistication grew, and they came to be seen as embodying the era's socio-cultural movements.</p>

                <div> <p>The Beatles were international stars by early 1964, leading the "British Invasion" of the United States pop market and breaking numerous sales records. They soon made their film debut with A Hard Day's Night (1964). From 1965 onwards, they produced increasingly innovative recordings, including the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and enjoyed further commercial success with The Beatles (also known as the "White Album", 1968) and Abbey Road (1969). In 1968, they founded Apple Corps, a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After the group's break-up in 1970, all four members enjoyed success as solo artists. Lennon was shot and killed in December 1980, and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001. </p> </div></div>
